**** Clause :

-- Clause is a combination of words with a subject and a verb.
-- For example,

    > Shardhha enjoyed.  [Shardhha -> Subject, enjoyed -> verb]
    > She is smiling because she remembered happy moments. ['She is smiling', 'she remembered happy moments' -> Clause]


**** Types of Clause :

1) Independent Clause:

-- Also known as Main Clause.
-- They make a complete meaningful sentence on their own without co-depending on other sentences.
-- For example,

    > Shradhha shouted.
    > Ketan watched movie.      [Ketan -> Subject, watched -> verb, movie -> object]

2) Dependent Clause:

-- Dependent clauses are a little more complicated.
-- Also known as Subordinating Clause.
-- dependent clauses alone are not complete sentences, even though they have both a subject and verb.
-- It is dependent on main clause for its meaning.
-- For example,

    > You bought for me.   [What ???]
    > Cat was smarter.     [Than whom ???]


Independent and dependent clause examples :

    > Independent: Next Tuesday will be my first day at my new job.
      Dependent:   If the interview goes well, next Tuesday will be my first day at my new job.
    
    > Independent: You have to finish your vegetables, and then you can eat dessert.
      Dependent:   You have to finish your vegetables before you can eat dessert.

Note : 

-- If the dependent clause comes first, use a comma between the two clauses.

    > Wherever you go, I will follow.

-- If the independent clause comes first, no comma is necessary.

    > I will follow wherever you go.
