-- Adverbs are a major part of speech that we use to modify verbs, adjectives, clauses, and even other adverbs.
-- Adverbs provide more information in a sentence by modifying another word.
-- For example, the adverb 'quickly' in the sentence - Jeremiah ran quickly - tells us that Jeremiah ran with high speed.
-- As another example, the adverb 'really' in the sentence - The movie was really boring - tells us that the movie wasn’t just boring but 
   that it was a colossal snooze-fest.

****** Different types of adverbs:

Conjunctive adverbs
Adverbs of frequency
Adverbs of time
Adverbs of manner
Adverbs of degree
Adverbs of place


1] Conjunctive adverbs:

-- Unlike the other types of adverbs we will look at, conjunctive adverbs play an important grammatical role in sentences. 
-- Basically, a conjunctive adverb is an adverb that acts like a conjunction; a conjunctive adverb is used to connect two clauses 
   or two sentences together. 
-- For example:

    > I went to the store to buy new shoes. 'However', the store was already closed when I got there.

-- In the second sentence, the conjunctive adverb 'however' tells us that this sentence is related to the one immediately before it. 
-- The adverb 'however' acts like a conjunction by linking these two sentences together.
-- We can also use conjunctive adverbs with a semicolon rather than a period:

    > Tina wasn’t too confident about her answers; 'nevertheless', she passed the exam easily.

-- Examples of conjunctive adverbs used in sentences :

    > Joey was playing in the sandbox. 'Meanwhile', his brother Noah was sleeping in a hammock.
    > Candy isn’t a healthy breakfast. 'Instead', you could eat fruit.

    > We can’t bake the cake because we ran out of milk. 'Also', we don’t have any eggs left.
    > The movie was the perfect fit for the director who loved action and explosions. 'Moreover', she had worked with the lead actor 
      in many other films.

    > I forgot to put on sunscreen. 'Consequently', I have a sunburn today.
    > Gorillas have proven to be very intelligent. 'For example', Koko the Gorilla was able to learn sign language. (To provide 
      evidence to an argument or prove a point)
    > Washington, DC, has several examples of neoclassical architecture. For instance, the Supreme Court building resembles a Greek 
      or Roman temple.  (To provide evidence to an argument or prove a point)
    > We got to go everywhere we wanted, and everyone had fun. 'All in all', it was a great trip. (To summarize a point)
    > Cheese, sauce, and crust combine to create a trifecta of deliciousness. 'In conclusion', pizza is the greatest food ever
