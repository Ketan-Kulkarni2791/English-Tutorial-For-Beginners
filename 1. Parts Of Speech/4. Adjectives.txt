-- Adjectives are one of the most exciting parts of speech that we have. 
-- Without adjectives, you wouldn’t be able to tell your friends which movies are 'great' and which are 'overrated'.
-- Adjectives also allow us to describe ourselves as being ''amazing'', 'incredible', 'fantastic', and—of course— 'humble'.
-- Most importantly, adjectives let us explain the difference between 'funny' memes and 'bad' ones.


****** What is an adjective?

-- An adjective is a word that modifies a noun or a pronoun.
-- In general, adjectives usually give us more information about a noun or pronoun by describing it or providing more information 
   about it.
