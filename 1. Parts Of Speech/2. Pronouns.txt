****** What are Pronouns ?

- Pronouns are also known as substitute of nouns.
-- A pronoun is a word that is used in place of a noun or a noun phrase to avoid repetation.
-- Such as he, she, you, me, him, me, myself etc.
-- Their job is to make communication faster and more efficient because you don’t have to repeat the same word over and over again.

-- WHY TO USE PRONOUNS ?
-- Let's see the following example:

    > Anay is a good boy. Anay plays football. Anay loves Anay's parents. Anay's parents love Anay.

-- Above example after using pronouns:

    > Anay is a good boy. He plays football. He loves his parents. His parents love him.


****** Types of Pronouns :

1. Personal pronouns
2. Possesive pronouns
3. Reflexive pronouns
4. Demonstrative pronouns
5. Interogative pronouns
6. Relative pronouns
7. Indefinite pronouns
8. Reciprocal pronouns


1] PERSONAL PRONOUNS:

-- When you think of pronouns, you most likely think first of personal pronouns.
-- those associated with a certain person, thing, or group.
-- Personal pronouns are always specific and are often used to replace a proper noun (someone’s name) or a collective group of 
   people or things.
-- Personal pronouns have two main groups, one referring to the subject of the sentence and one to the object.
-- The first is used to replace the subject of the sentence: I, you, he, she, it, we, you and they.
-- Notice that you is repeated as you can be singular, addressing one person, or plural, addressing a group of people. 
-- So there are two types of pronouns :

1. Subjective Pronouns : I, you, we, they, he, she, it.
2. Objective Pronouns : me, you, us, them, him, her, it.

-- Here, if I say : I met Shradhha. I becomes the subject and Shradhha becomes the object.
-- When I say : Shradhha met me. Shradhha becomes the subject and I become the object i.e. me.
-- More examples,

    > He is waiting for me.             [Subjective pronoun : He, Objective pronoun : me]
    > Cab driver is waiting for me.     [Subjective pronoun : Cab driver, Objective pronoun : me]
    > She runs fast. Did you see her ?  [Subjective pronoun : She, you, Objective pronoun : her]
    > You are clever. I know you.       [Subjective pronoun : You, I, Objective pronoun : you]
    > I have done it.                   [Subjective pronoun : I, Objective pronoun : it]
    > We will give gifts to them.       [Subjective pronoun : We, Objective pronoun : them]
