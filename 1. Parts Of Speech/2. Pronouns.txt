****** What are Pronouns ?

- Pronouns are also known as substitute of nouns.
-- A pronoun is a word that is used in place of a noun or a noun phrase to avoid repetation.
-- Such as he, she, you, me, him, me, myself etc.
-- Their job is to make communication faster and more efficient because you don’t have to repeat the same word over and over again.

-- WHY TO USE PRONOUNS ?
-- Let's see the following example:

    > Anay is a good boy. Anay plays football. Anay loves Anay's parents. Anay's parents love Anay.

-- Above example after using pronouns:

    > Anay is a good boy. He plays football. He loves his parents. His parents love him.


****** Types of Pronouns :

1. Personal pronouns
2. Possesive pronouns
3. Reflexive pronouns
4. Demonstrative pronouns
5. Interogative pronouns
6. Relative pronouns
7. Indefinite pronouns
8. Reciprocal pronouns


1] PERSONAL PRONOUNS:

-- When you think of pronouns, you most likely think first of personal pronouns.
-- those associated with a certain person, thing, or group.
-- Personal pronouns are always specific and are often used to replace a proper noun (someone’s name) or a collective group of 
   people or things.
-- Personal pronouns have two main groups, one referring to the subject of the sentence and one to the object.
-- The first is used to replace the subject of the sentence: I, you, he, she, it, we, you and they.
-- Notice that you is repeated as you can be singular, addressing one person, or plural, addressing a group of people. 
-- So there are two types of pronouns :

1. Subjective Pronouns : I, you, we, they, he, she, it.
2. Objective Pronouns : me, you, us, them, him, her, it.

-- Here, if I say : I met Shradhha. I becomes the subject and Shradhha becomes the object.
-- When I say : Shradhha met me. Shradhha becomes the subject and I become the object i.e. me.
-- More examples,

    > He is waiting for me.             [Subjective pronoun : He, Objective pronoun : me]
    > Cab driver is waiting for me.     [Subjective pronoun : Cab driver, Objective pronoun : me]
    > She runs fast. Did you see her ?  [Subjective pronoun : She, you, Objective pronoun : her]
    > You are clever. I know you.       [Subjective pronoun : You, I, Objective pronoun : you]
    > I have done it.                   [Subjective pronoun : I, Objective pronoun : it]
    > We will give gifts to them.       [Subjective pronoun : We, Objective pronoun : them]


2] POSSESSIVE PRONOUNS:

-- As the name implies, possessive pronouns show ownership.
-- Possessive pronouns are words used to indicate that something belongs to someone or has a direct relationship with someone else.
-- They are often used in speech and writing to avoid repetition.
-- For example,

    > I had dinner with Shradhha and Shradhha’s brother, Mayur.

-- To avoid repeating the name Jane in the sentence, we use the possessive pronoun her to make the sentence neater and less repetitive:

    > I had dinner with Shradhha and her brother, Mayur.

-- There are two types of pronouns :

1. Dependent Possessive Pronouns    : my, our, your, his, her, its, and their.
2. Independent Possessive Pronouns  : mine, ours, yours, his, hers, its, and theirs.

    (1) Dependent Possessive Pronouns :

    -- Sometimes called possessive adjectives.
    -- They are used to indicate ownership or a relationship.
    -- For example:

        > This is my
        > Is this man your husband?
        > Welcome to our
        > The dog chased its
    
    -- The rule of dependent possessive pronouns is that they are used before a noun.
    -- You can think of them this way: they are dependent on the noun that comes after them.
    -- The possessive pronouns are mostly used to show ownership between a person and the noun that follows.
    -- However, there are some instances when we don’t exactly own the thing in question – people, countries, jobs etc. – but in 
       these cases the possessive pronoun is used to show ownership in the sense of a direct relationship:

        > I love my
        > Is Jamaica your country of birth?
        > Those are her
    
    -- Sometimes an adjective can come between the possessive pronoun and noun, but only if it is acting as a modifier for that noun:

        > I lost my favourite pencil.
        > Did you see her blue dress?

    -- More examples of dependent possessive pronouns:

        > My plane is delayed.
        > My cab is delayed.
        > Your dinner is ready.
        > Could you bring 'his' tea out to him?
        > Remember not to judge a book by 'its' cover.
        > I would have knocked on 'their' door, but I heard 'their' baby crying.
    
    (2) Independent Possessive Pronouns :

    -- Mine, ours, yours, his, hers and theirs are the independent possessive pronouns.
    -- They are not immediately followed by a noun.
    -- You can think of them this way: they are independent because they don’t need a noun after them.
    -- For example:

        > The car parked outside is mine.
        > If the candy bar isn’t yours, it must belong to someone else.
        > This cake is
        > It is mine.
    
    -- An independent possessive pronoun will normally come at the end of the sentence or clause.
    -- While it should not be followed by a noun, it does need auxiliary information before it appears to show the reader what the 
       possessive pronoun is indicating ownership of – the cake, candy bar, car etc.
    -- For example, if we simply say it is mine, we won’t know what it is. We will only know whose it is.
    -- For us to know what it is, we need information before the possessive pronoun appears.
    -- More examples of independent possessive pronouns:

        > My phone is dead. Pass me 'yours'.
        > Did you know that desk is 'mine'?
        > The house on the corner is 'theirs'.
        > That dress is 'hers'.



-- The independent possessive pronouns are mine, ours, yours, his, hers, its, and theirs.
-- For example,

    > This is my book.                  [Possesive determiners : my]
    > This book is mine.                [Independent possessive pronoun : mine]
    > Where is yours ?                  [Independent possessive pronoun : yours]



3] REFLEXIVE PRONOUNS :

-- Reflexive pronouns are words ending in -self or -selves that are used when the subject and the object of a sentence are the 
   same (e.g., I believe in myself).
-- They can act as either objects or indirect objects. 
-- The nine English reflexive pronouns are myself, yourself, himself, herself, oneself, itself, ourselves, yourselves, and 
   themselves.

** Reflexive pronouns are direct or indirect objects:

-- A reflexive pronoun can be a direct object in a sentence when the subject and the direct object are one and the same.
-- In English grammar, a direct object is a word or phrase that receives the action of the verb. In the sentence - The students eat 
   cake - the direct object is cake; the word eat is the verb and cake is what’s being eaten.
-- Example of direct object:

    > Jack decided to reward Mary with a dinner out.
    > Jack decided to reward himself with a dinner out.

-- In the first sentence, Mary is the object of reward. Jack, the subject, is the object of reward in the second sentence, so we 
   use the pronoun himself.

-- Reflexive pronouns can also play the indirect object role in a sentence.
-- In English grammar, an indirect object is the word or phrase that receives the direct object. In the sentence - The teacher gave 
   the students cake - the indirect object is the students. The direct object is cake, and the students are the ones who eat it. 
-- Example of indirect object:

    > He knitted himself a new sweater.
    > Cynthia pours herself a cup of tea every morning.

-- It is worth noting that referring twice to the same noun as subject and object (rather than using a reflexive pronoun for the 
   object) sounds just a bit creepy.
-- “Jack decided to cook Jack a special supper,” for example, sounds unnerving to a primary English speaker.

** Common errors with reflexive pronouns:

    > Andrew and myself will conduct today’s meeting.           INCORRECT
    > Andrew and I will conduct today’s meeting.                CORRECT

    > You may submit your expenses to Mr. Martin or myself before Friday.       INCORRECT
    > You may submit your expenses to Mr. Martin or me before Friday.           CORRECT

    > You may submit your expenses to myself before Friday.     INCORRECT
    > You may submit your expenses to me before Friday.         CORRECT

    > He had a suitcase beside him. (NOT himself)           [prepositions of place]
    > He had a suitcase beside him. (NOT himself)           [prepositions of place]
    > She had a few friends with her. (NOT herself)         [after with when it means accompanied by]

-- Some more examples,

    > Be careful with that knife. You might cut yourself.
    > We’ve brought ourselves something to eat.
    > The children got dressed by themselves.
    > I prepared the whole meal by myself.
    > He lived by himself in an enormous house.
    > She walked home by herself.
    > I cooked the food myself.


4] DEMONSTRATIVE PRONOUNS:

-- A demonstrative pronoun is a pronoun used to point to specific people or things.
-- For example, imagine there was a chair right next to you and a chair across the room from you.
-- When talking about the chair nearer to you, you would say This is a chair.
-- When talking about the chair far away from you, you would point to it and say That is a chair.
-- In these sentences, the words this and that are demonstrative pronouns.
-- Demonstrative pronouns can be used to refer to either people, animals, or objects.
-- For example,

    > People: This is my friend Rahul.
    > Animals: That looks like a poisonous snake.
    > Objects: The cars in the front are worth more than those in the back.

-- A demonstrative pronoun can be used as either a subject or an object:

    > Subject: I think I need new shoes. These are pretty old.
    > Object: What is that?
