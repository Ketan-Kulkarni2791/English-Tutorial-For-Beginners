****** What are Pronouns ?

- Pronouns are also known as substitute of nouns.
-- A pronoun is a word that is used in place of a noun or a noun phrase to avoid repetation.
-- Such as he, she, you, me, him, me, myself etc.
-- Their job is to make communication faster and more efficient because you don’t have to repeat the same word over and over again.

-- WHY TO USE PRONOUNS ?
-- Let's see the following example:

    > Anay is a good boy. Anay plays football. Anay loves Anay's parents. Anay's parents love Anay.

-- Above example after using pronouns:

    > Anay is a good boy. He plays football. He loves his parents. His parents love him.


****** Types of Pronouns :

1. Personal pronouns
2. Possesive pronouns
3. Reflexive pronouns
4. Demonstrative pronouns
5. Interogative pronouns
6. Relative pronouns
7. Indefinite pronouns
8. Reciprocal pronouns


1] PERSONAL PRONOUNS:

-- When you think of pronouns, you most likely think first of personal pronouns.
-- those associated with a certain person, thing, or group.
-- Personal pronouns are always specific and are often used to replace a proper noun (someone’s name) or a collective group of 
   people or things.
-- Personal pronouns have two main groups, one referring to the subject of the sentence and one to the object.
-- The first is used to replace the subject of the sentence: I, you, he, she, it, we, you and they.
-- Notice that you is repeated as you can be singular, addressing one person, or plural, addressing a group of people. 
-- So there are two types of pronouns :

1. Subjective Pronouns : I, you, we, they, he, she, it.
2. Objective Pronouns : me, you, us, them, him, her, it.

-- Here, if I say : I met Shradhha. I becomes the subject and Shradhha becomes the object.
-- When I say : Shradhha met me. Shradhha becomes the subject and I become the object i.e. me.
-- More examples,

    > He is waiting for me.             [Subjective pronoun : He, Objective pronoun : me]
    > Cab driver is waiting for me.     [Subjective pronoun : Cab driver, Objective pronoun : me]
    > She runs fast. Did you see her ?  [Subjective pronoun : She, you, Objective pronoun : her]
    > You are clever. I know you.       [Subjective pronoun : You, I, Objective pronoun : you]
    > I have done it.                   [Subjective pronoun : I, Objective pronoun : it]
    > We will give gifts to them.       [Subjective pronoun : We, Objective pronoun : them]


2] POSSESSIVE PRONOUNS:

-- As the name implies, possessive pronouns show ownership.
-- Possessive pronouns are words used to indicate that something belongs to someone or has a direct relationship with someone else.
-- They are often used in speech and writing to avoid repetition.
-- For example,

    > I had dinner with Shradhha and Shradhha’s brother, Mayur.

-- To avoid repeating the name Jane in the sentence, we use the possessive pronoun her to make the sentence neater and less repetitive:

    > I had dinner with Shradhha and her brother, Mayur.

-- There are two types of pronouns :

1. Dependent Possessive Pronouns    : my, our, your, his, her, its, and their.
2. Independent Possessive Pronouns  : mine, ours, yours, his, hers, its, and theirs.

    (1) Dependent Possessive Pronouns :

    -- Sometimes called possessive adjectives.
    -- They are used to indicate ownership or a relationship.
    -- For example:

        > This is my
        > Is this man your husband?
        > Welcome to our
        > The dog chased its
    
    -- The rule of dependent possessive pronouns is that they are used before a noun.
    -- You can think of them this way: they are dependent on the noun that comes after them.
    -- The possessive pronouns are mostly used to show ownership between a person and the noun that follows.
    -- However, there are some instances when we don’t exactly own the thing in question – people, countries, jobs etc. – but in 
       these cases the possessive pronoun is used to show ownership in the sense of a direct relationship:

        > I love my
        > Is Jamaica your country of birth?
        > Those are her
    
    -- Sometimes an adjective can come between the possessive pronoun and noun, but only if it is acting as a modifier for that noun:

        > I lost my favourite pencil.
        > Did you see her blue dress?

    -- More examples of dependent possessive pronouns:

        > My plane is delayed.
        > My cab is delayed.
        > Your dinner is ready.
        > Could you bring 'his' tea out to him?
        > Remember not to judge a book by 'its' cover.
        > I would have knocked on 'their' door, but I heard 'their' baby crying.
    
    (2) Independent Possessive Pronouns :

    -- Mine, ours, yours, his, hers and theirs are the independent possessive pronouns.
    -- They are not immediately followed by a noun.
    -- You can think of them this way: they are independent because they don’t need a noun after them.
    -- For example:

        > The car parked outside is mine.
        > If the candy bar isn’t yours, it must belong to someone else.
        > This cake is
        > It is mine.
    
    -- An independent possessive pronoun will normally come at the end of the sentence or clause.
    -- While it should not be followed by a noun, it does need auxiliary information before it appears to show the reader what the 
       possessive pronoun is indicating ownership of – the cake, candy bar, car etc.
    -- For example, if we simply say it is mine, we won’t know what it is. We will only know whose it is.
    -- For us to know what it is, we need information before the possessive pronoun appears.
    -- More examples of independent possessive pronouns:

        > My phone is dead. Pass me 'yours'.
        > Did you know that desk is 'mine'?
        > The house on the corner is 'theirs'.
        > That dress is 'hers'.



-- The independent possessive pronouns are mine, ours, yours, his, hers, its, and theirs.
-- For example,

    > This is my book.                  [Possesive determiners : my]
    > This book is mine.                [Independent possessive pronoun : mine]
    > Where is yours ?                  [Independent possessive pronoun : yours]



3] REFLEXIVE PRONOUNS :

-- Reflexive pronouns are words ending in -self or -selves that are used when the subject and the object of a sentence are the 
   same (e.g., I believe in myself).
-- They can act as either objects or indirect objects. 
-- The nine English reflexive pronouns are myself, yourself, himself, herself, oneself, itself, ourselves, yourselves, and 
   themselves.

** Reflexive pronouns are direct or indirect objects:

-- A reflexive pronoun can be a direct object in a sentence when the subject and the direct object are one and the same.
-- In English grammar, a direct object is a word or phrase that receives the action of the verb. In the sentence - The students eat 
   cake - the direct object is cake; the word eat is the verb and cake is what’s being eaten.
-- Example of direct object:

    > Jack decided to reward Mary with a dinner out.
    > Jack decided to reward himself with a dinner out.

-- In the first sentence, Mary is the object of reward. Jack, the subject, is the object of reward in the second sentence, so we 
   use the pronoun himself.

-- Reflexive pronouns can also play the indirect object role in a sentence.
-- In English grammar, an indirect object is the word or phrase that receives the direct object. In the sentence - The teacher gave 
   the students cake - the indirect object is the students. The direct object is cake, and the students are the ones who eat it. 
-- Example of indirect object:

    > He knitted himself a new sweater.
    > Cynthia pours herself a cup of tea every morning.

-- It is worth noting that referring twice to the same noun as subject and object (rather than using a reflexive pronoun for the 
   object) sounds just a bit creepy.
-- “Jack decided to cook Jack a special supper,” for example, sounds unnerving to a primary English speaker.

** Common errors with reflexive pronouns:

    > Andrew and myself will conduct today’s meeting.           INCORRECT
    > Andrew and I will conduct today’s meeting.                CORRECT

    > You may submit your expenses to Mr. Martin or myself before Friday.       INCORRECT
    > You may submit your expenses to Mr. Martin or me before Friday.           CORRECT

    > You may submit your expenses to myself before Friday.     INCORRECT
    > You may submit your expenses to me before Friday.         CORRECT

    > He had a suitcase beside him. (NOT himself)           [prepositions of place]
    > He had a suitcase beside him. (NOT himself)           [prepositions of place]
    > She had a few friends with her. (NOT herself)         [after with when it means accompanied by]

-- Some more examples,

    > Be careful with that knife. You might cut yourself.
    > We’ve brought ourselves something to eat.
    > The children got dressed by themselves.
    > I prepared the whole meal by myself.
    > He lived by himself in an enormous house.
    > She walked home by herself.
    > I cooked the food myself.


4] DEMONSTRATIVE PRONOUNS:

-- A demonstrative pronoun is a pronoun used to point to specific people or things.
-- For example, imagine there was a chair right next to you and a chair across the room from you.
-- When talking about the chair nearer to you, you would say This is a chair.
-- When talking about the chair far away from you, you would point to it and say That is a chair.
-- In these sentences, the words this and that are demonstrative pronouns.
-- Demonstrative pronouns can be used to refer to either people, animals, or objects.
-- For example,

    > People: This is my friend Rahul.
    > Animals: That looks like a poisonous snake.
    > Objects: The cars in the front are worth more than those in the back.

-- A demonstrative pronoun can be used as either a subject or an object:

    > Subject: I think I need new shoes. These are pretty old.
    > Object: What is that?

*** List of demonstrative pronouns:

1) Singular demonstrative pronouns:

    -- The words this and that are singular demonstrative pronouns.
    -- They are used to refer to a single person or thing. 
    -- The word this is used to refer to things close by, and that is used to refer to things far away.
    -- In addition to being used as a demonstrative pronoun, the word that has many different meanings and can be used as an adjective, 
       adverb, or a conjunction in addition to a pronoun.

2) Plural demonstrative pronouns:

    -- The words these and those are plural demonstrative pronouns.
    -- They are used to refer to more than one person or thing.
    -- These is used to refer to nearby things, and those is used to refer to faraway objects.

-- More examples of demonstrative pronouns:

    > This is a really weird-looking fruit.
    > I can’t believe she said that.
    > We are going to need boxes that are a lot bigger than these.
    > The restaurants here are a lot newer than those across town.

    > ✅ Correct: That is an expensive car.
      ❌ Incorrect: That are an expensive car.

      ✅ Correct: Those look delicious.
      ❌ Incorrect: Those looks delicious.



5] INTEROGATIVE PRONOUNS:

-- Who is your best friend? What is your favorite food? Which of the colors of the rainbow is your favorite? One final question: 
   what is a pronoun? If you are a grammar master, you already know that a pronoun is a word that we use to replace a noun.
-- Pronouns show up in a lot of our sentences, including questions.
-- A type of pronoun known as an interrogative pronoun is always looking for answers.
-- n interrogative pronoun is a pronoun used to ask a question.
--  For example:

    > What is a pineapple? A pineapple is a fruit.
    > Who built this shed? Carl built this shed.

-- Usually, an interrogative pronoun is the first word in an interrogative sentence, which always ends in a question mark.
-- For example,

    > I wonder who will come tomorrow.
    > She asked us what we wanted for lunch.

*** List of interrogative pronouns :

-- The five most commonly used interrogative pronouns are who, whom, whose, what, and which.
-- Less commonly, longer forms of these words ending in -ever are also used: whoever, whomever, whosever, whatever, and whichever.
-- As interrogative pronouns, these variants may be used for emphasis or to express surprise.
-- All of these pronouns can act as singular or plural words depending on what they are referring to.

    1) Who and whom :

    -- Who and whom are used to ask questions where the answer is expected to be a person
    -- Who is used as a subject, and whom is used as an object.

    2) Whose :

    -- Whose is used to ask questions about possessions, ownership, or a relationship.

    3) What :

    -- What is used to ask a question where the answer is expected to be an object or abstract concept.

    4) Which :

    -- Which is used to ask questions where there are multiple choices or possibilities as to what the answer could be.

*** Examples of interrogative pronouns :

    1) Who and whom :

        > Who took the towel?
        > Who will win the championship?
        > Whom did you give the key to?
        > Whom did the police suspect of the crime?
    
    2) Whose :

        > I found this purse. Whose is this?
        > There are shoes by the door. Whose are they?
        > Look at that big house over there. Whose is it?
    
    3) What :

        > What is love?
        > What are those flowers called?
        > What are we going to do?
    
    4) Which :

        > Which of these cookies do you want?
        > She either cleaned her room or she didn’t. Which is it?
        > We can go to the beach or the park. Which sounds more fun?

*** How to use interrogative pronouns :

-- Usually, interrogative pronouns are the first word used in questions:

    > Who was that?
    > What is her favorite color?

-- However, it is possible to use an interrogative pronoun later in a question:

    > You gave the money to whom?
    > Excuse me? You used what to make this ice cream?


6] RELATIVE PRONOUNS:

-- "The reason that plants are green is a substance called chlorophyll.", "Tortoises, which are reptiles, can live for hundreds 
   of years."
-- You probably know pronouns replace nouns in sentences and do a lot of the same jobs that nouns do.
-- In above examples, we have used a special type of pronoun that we can use to provide additional information about nouns and 
   pronouns through dependent clauses.
-- These pronouns are called relative pronouns.
-- Relative pronouns can really spice up your sentences, as long as you know how to use them correctly.

*** What is a relative pronoun? 

-- A relative pronoun is a pronoun that is used to introduce a relative clause.
-- In particular, relative pronouns usually introduce relative clauses that describe nouns or other pronouns.
-- For example, the word that is a relative pronoun in the sentence - Find me the book that has money hidden in it.
-- A relative clause is a type of subordinate clause (also known as a dependent clause), which means that it can’t stand by 
   itself as a complete sentence. For example,

    > Independent clause: Shilpa is a friend (The clause can stand alone.)
      Dependent clause: who is always there for me (The clause can’t stand alone.)

-- Relative pronouns typically lead relative clauses and, in a manner of speaking, attach them to an independent clause. 
   For example,

    > Shilpa is a friend who is always there for me.

-- In this sentence, the relative pronoun who introduces a dependent clause that modifies the noun friend.

*** Whose :

-- The word whose is both a possessive pronoun and a relative pronoun.
-- We use whose to introduce a relative clause describing someone or something’s possession(s).

    > I found the person whose cat lost their collar. (Whose cat lost their collar modifies the word person. Whose introduces 
      a clause that describes a cat that belongs to the person.)

*** Which and that :

-- Which and that are used in relative clauses that describe objects or animals.
-- In general, the word which is used to introduce nonessential information and that is used to give important information.

    > Hawaiian pizza, which is my favorite food, is delicious. (Which is my favorite food modifies the noun phrase Hawaiian pizza. 
      Which introduces a relative clause that provides nonessential additional information.)
    > This is the puppy that won the contest. (That won the contest modifies the word puppy. That introduces a relative clause with 
      important additional information that specifically tells us how the puppy is different from all other puppies.)

-- Some more examples,

    > I need to find a roommate who doesn’t smoke.
    > The employee helped the customer whom the manager brought over.
    > She gave a ride to a tourist whose family was from Sweden.
    > The computer, which I bought yesterday, is on top of my desk.
    > The uniform that had been worn by Napoleon was on display in the museum.

*** Who and whom :

-- The words who and whom often cause people difficulty. 
-- Remember: who is used as a subject and whom is used as an object.

    > The company hired guides (who/whom) spoke Spanish.
    > Dennis was the one (who/whom) Albert gave the keys to.
    > Katrina is the girl whom I like.


7] INDEFINITE PRONOUNS:

-- Nouns are important parts of speech that refer to people, places, things, and ideas.
-- Sometimes, nouns need a break and ask pronouns to fill in for them.
-- Pronouns can do all of the jobs that nouns do, such as acting as subjects or objects in sentences.
-- However, there is a certain type of pronoun that doesn’t seem too motivated to do its job: the indefinite pronoun.
-- An indefinite pronoun is a pronoun that doesn’t specifically identify what it is referring to.
-- For example, the word someone is an indefinite pronoun in the sentence - Someone ate the last slice of pizza.
-- We know that the pronoun someone refers to a human being but we don’t know any other information about them.
-- Indefinite pronouns vaguely or generally refer to a person or thing.
-- Indefinite pronouns have a variety of uses. Some of these include:

    > Referring to an unknown person: The witness saw somebody sneaking around.
    > Referring to a general amount: Most of the kids left, but several of them are still here.
    > Referring to a totality or an absence: We tried everything, but nothing worked.

*** Singular indefinite pronouns :

-- Listed below are indefinite pronouns that are typically used as singular. 
-- When used in a sentence, these words typically take a singular verb:

    > another, anybody, anyone, anything, each, either, enough, everyone, everybody, everyone, everything, less, little, much, 
      neither, nobody, no one, nothing, one, other, somebody, someone, something

*** Plural indefinite pronouns :

-- Listed below are the indefinite pronouns that are treated as plural.
-- When used in sentences, these words typically use a plural verb:

    > both, few, fewer, many, others, several

*** Indefinite pronouns that can be singular or plural :

-- Listed below are the indefinite pronouns that are treated as plural.
-- When used in sentences, these words typically use a plural verb:

    > both, few, fewer, many, others, several

*** Indefinite pronouns that can be singular or plural :

-- Depending on the sentence, the following indefinite pronouns can be either singular or plural
-- The verb they use will depend on if these words are acting as singular or plural:

    > all, any, more, most, none, some, such

*** Singular indefinite pronouns :

    > He had barely finished his first soda before he started to drink 'another'.
    > 'Everyone' was shocked by the sudden announcement.
    > 'Little' is known about the ancient civilization.
    > My data shows that 'nobody' thinks a hot dog is a sandwich.
    > 'Something' smells really good in the kitchen.

*** Plural indefinite pronouns :

    > 'Both' of my friends are hungry.
    > We invited 'all' of the neighbors to the picnic, but 'few' have come.
    > 'Many' of the cats have striped tails.
    > 'Several' of the boys know how to swim.
    > This particular plane functions underwater, but 'others' do not.

*** Singular or plural indefinite pronouns :

    > 'All' of the trash is gone.
    > 'All' of my sisters are blonde.
    > 'Most' of the drinks 'are' already gone.
    > 'Most' of the town 'is' covered in snow.
    > 'Some' of the pie 'has been eaten', and 'some' of the potatoes are missing.

*** How to use indefinite pronouns :

-- Like all other pronouns, indefinite pronouns can only be used the same ways as nouns. This means that indefinite pronouns can 
   function as a subject or an object in a sentence.

    > Subject: 'No one' knows what to do.
    > Object: She was talking to 'someone' on the phone.

-- The main thing to watch out for when using indefinite pronouns is that they adhere to subject-verb agreement.
-- If an indefinite pronoun is treated as singular, it must use a singular verb. Likewise, if a pronoun is treated as plural, 
   it must use a plural verb.

    ✅ Correct: One of us was hiding something.
    ❌ Incorrect: One of us were hiding something.

    ✅ Correct: Both of the planets have rings.
    ❌ Incorrect: Both of the planets has rings.

-- You need to watch out for collective nouns, which are nouns that collectively refer to multiple people or things as one unit.
-- If a collective noun is being used to refer to an entire group as a cohesive unit, use a singular noun. If the collective noun 
   is being used to refer to the group members individually, use a plural noun.

    > Singular: 'Some' of the team 'is' missing. (The members are not all present.)
    > Plural: 'Some' of the team 'are' doing practice drills. (Individual members are performing drills.)



8] RECIPROCAL PRONOUNS:

-- Friends are always ready to help 'each other', Friends are also willing to lend 'one another' support through the hard times.
   Most importantly, friends protect 'each other' from the perils of … bad grammar and common English mistakes. 
   (Or is that just us?)
-- Truly, friendship is a beautiful thing, and this is certainly the case when it comes to nouns and pronouns.
-- A pronoun is a word that can substitute for a noun in a sentence.
-- In our discussion of friendship, we used a type of pronoun called a reciprocal pronoun to say what friends do for each other.
-- A reciprocal pronoun is a pronoun that expresses a mutual relationship.
-- Putting it another way, reciprocal pronouns refer to a situation where someone or something performs an action on others and 
   receives the same action in return.
-- For example, the sentence - Andrew and Bill helped each other - means that Andrew helped Bill and Bill helped Andrew.
-- As another example, the sentence - The members of the team supported one another - means that every member of the team supported 
   every other member of the team.
-- The people who performed the actions also received them in return.

*** List of reciprocal pronouns :

-- Most style guides only consider there to be two reciprocal pronouns, and both of them consist of two words. These reciprocal 
   pronouns are:

    > each other
    > one another

-- Be cautious of each other. The words each and other can be used by themselves as indefinite pronouns.
-- Additionally, the word 'each' can be used as an adjective or an adverb, and the word 'other' can be used as an adjective, adverb, 
   noun, or even a verb.

*** Examples of reciprocal pronouns :

-- Let’s look at how we use reciprocal pronouns in sentences to express mutual relationships.

1) Each other :

    > Romeo and Juliet love each other.
    > The coaches spoke to each other about strategy.
    > The chimpanzees shared food with each other.

2) One another :

    > The members of the board congratulated one another on a successful quarter.
    > At the roast, the guests took turns making jokes about one another.
    > The elephants stood close together in order to protect one another.

*** How to use reciprocal pronouns :

-- There is one important thing to know about reciprocal pronouns that separates them from other pronouns.
-- Unlike other pronouns, reciprocal pronouns typically only make grammatical sense when they are used as objects. 
-- This means that we usually do not put a reciprocal pronoun as the subject of a sentence, clause, or phrase.

     ✅ Correct: Barry and Mary are friends. They smiled at each other.
    ❌ Incorrect:  Barry and Mary are friends. Each other smiled at them.

-- It is also important to know that reciprocal pronouns have different meanings than reflexive pronouns.
-- These two types of pronouns usually cannot be used interchangeably because the meaning of the sentence will change.
-- For example:

    > Reciprocal pronoun: Jenny and Kenny hugged each other. (This sentence means Jenny hugged Kenny and Kenny hugged Jenny.)
    > Reflexive pronoun:  Jenny and Kenny hugged themselves. (This sentence means that Jenny hugged herself and Kenny hugged 
      himself.)
    
-- It is possible to use each other and one another as possessive words:

    > The students looked over 'each other’s' homework.
    > The countries agreed to respect 'one another’s' trade routes.
