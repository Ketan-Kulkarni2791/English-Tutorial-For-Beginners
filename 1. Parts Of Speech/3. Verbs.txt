-- Want to know where all the action is? Verbs!
-- Verbs are words that represent actions that are external (run, jump, work) and internal (love, think, consider).
-- Without verbs, you can’t do anything, you can’t feel anything—you can’t even be anything.  

*** What is a verb? 

-- Let’s start with the basics: What is a verb? Verbs are words that describe actions, whether physical or mental.
-- Verbs also describe a “state of being,” like the verbs be, become, or exist. 

    > Shradhha ran across the field, kicked the ball, and scored a goal. 
    > “I am the State.” —King Louis XIV

-- Some verbs also act as “helper verbs” to change the tense of another verb.
-- Likewise, these helper verbs can change a positive statement to a negative one with words like “not.” 

    > She has been jogging for a month and already feels her stamina increasing. 
    > “I don’t feel so good.” —Spider-Man

-- Every sentence needs at least one verb. If there’s no verb, it’s an incomplete sentence or a sentence fragment.
-- Except for imperative sentences (commands), a sentence also needs a subject, the thing doing the action. 


*** Types of verbs :

1] Dynamic (action) verbs :

-- Most verbs describe a physical action or activity, something external that can be seen or heard.
-- These verbs are formally known as dynamic verbs, but can also be called action or event verbs.  

    > Examples: walk, laugh, swim, play, eat, drink, sing, dance, talk, say

-- There are a lot of actions that take place in our minds and feelings, which are not external. 
-- Verbs that describe mental or internal actions are still dynamic verbs, but they’re not always so obvious.
-- These include “process verbs,” which describe actions of transition. 

    > Examples: consider, guess, change, grow, live, endure, succeed, fail


2] Stative (state-of-being) verbs :

-- The opposite of dynamic verbs of action is stative verbs of being.
-- Stative verbs describe a subject’s state or feeling, including things they like and don’t like. 

    > Examples: want, need, prefer, love, hate, like, dislike, seem, understand, know, believe, involve, realize

-- One of the most important parts of stative verbs is that you can’t use them in the continuous tenses.
-- Stative verbs stick to the simple tenses, or occasionally use the perfect. 
-- he trouble is that some verbs can be dynamic or stative, depending on the specific meaning and how they’re used.
-- This includes the most popular verb be. Let’s take a deeper look at these.

    ***  Verbs that can be dynamic or stative :

    -- A lot of verbs have more than one meaning, so they can be used as dynamic or stative. These include perception words: see, 
       hear, taste, smell, feel.

    *** Auxiliary (helping) verbs :

    -- Auxiliary verbs, or “helping verbs,” are used in English to change another verb’s tense, voice, or mood.
    -- When auxiliary verbs are used, there’s always a main verb that represents the main action. However, the auxiliary verb must 
       still be conjugated correctly.
    -- he main auxiliary verbs are 'be', 'have', and 'do'.
    -- We explain how they’re used specifically for conjugating below, but here are a few quick examples: 

        > I have eaten sushi many times before. (tense)
        > That piece of sushi was eaten by me. (voice)
        > Did you eat my sushi? (mood)

    *** Modal auxiliary verbs :

    -- Some auxiliary verbs are added to another verb to show necessity, possibility, or capability.
    -- Like other auxiliary verbs, modal auxiliary verbs are not the main verb, but they do change its meaning slightly.
    -- Some common examples are  - can, may, could, should, would, must, ought, and might.

        > I could swim across the English Channel, but 'should' I do it? 
        > She must be the strongest person on the team, and 'might' be the strongest person in the region. 
    
    *** Phrasal verbs :

    -- Phrasal verbs are phrases that act as individual verbs, often combining two or more words and changing their meaning.
    -- The verb get, for example, becomes many different phrasal verbs when combined with different prepositions. 

        > When the bus stops, passengers get out on the sidewalk. 
        > After losing his job, he’s getting by on savings.
    
    -- The important thing to remember about phrasal verbs is that they act as a single verb, so you can still use them with other 
       verbs and prepositions.
