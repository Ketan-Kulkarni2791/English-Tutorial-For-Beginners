-- Want to know where all the action is? Verbs!
-- Verbs are words that represent actions that are external (run, jump, work) and internal (love, think, consider).
-- Without verbs, you can’t do anything, you can’t feel anything—you can’t even be anything.  

*** What is a verb? 

-- Let’s start with the basics: What is a verb? Verbs are words that describe actions, whether physical or mental.
-- Verbs also describe a “state of being,” like the verbs be, become, or exist. 

    > Shradhha ran across the field, kicked the ball, and scored a goal. 
    > “I am the State.” —King Louis XIV

-- Some verbs also act as “helper verbs” to change the tense of another verb.
-- Likewise, these helper verbs can change a positive statement to a negative one with words like “not.” 

    > She has been jogging for a month and already feels her stamina increasing. 
    > “I don’t feel so good.” —Spider-Man

-- Every sentence needs at least one verb. If there’s no verb, it’s an incomplete sentence or a sentence fragment.
-- Except for imperative sentences (commands), a sentence also needs a subject, the thing doing the action. 


****** Types of verbs :


1] Dynamic (action) verbs :

-- Most verbs describe a physical action or activity, something external that can be seen or heard.
-- These verbs are formally known as dynamic verbs, but can also be called action or event verbs.  

    > Examples: walk, laugh, swim, play, eat, drink, sing, dance, talk, say

-- There are a lot of actions that take place in our minds and feelings, which are not external. 
-- Verbs that describe mental or internal actions are still dynamic verbs, but they’re not always so obvious.
-- These include “process verbs,” which describe actions of transition. 

    > Examples: consider, guess, change, grow, live, endure, succeed, fail


2] Stative (state-of-being) verbs :

-- The opposite of dynamic verbs of action is stative verbs of being.
-- Stative verbs describe a subject’s state or feeling, including things they like and don’t like. 

    > Examples: want, need, prefer, love, hate, like, dislike, seem, understand, know, believe, involve, realize

-- One of the most important parts of stative verbs is that you can’t use them in the continuous tenses.
-- Stative verbs stick to the simple tenses, or occasionally use the perfect. 
-- he trouble is that some verbs can be dynamic or stative, depending on the specific meaning and how they’re used.
-- This includes the most popular verb be. Let’s take a deeper look at these.

    ***  Verbs that can be dynamic or stative :

    -- A lot of verbs have more than one meaning, so they can be used as dynamic or stative. These include perception words: see, 
       hear, taste, smell, feel.


3] Linking verbs :

-- Linking verbs are a special type of stative verb whose name gives a big clue as to what they do.
-- Linking verbs are used to link a subject with a subject complement.
-- A subject complement describes or identifies the subject of the sentence or clause.
-- Linking verbs can function as intransitive verbs, which do not take direct objects.
-- List of words used as linking verbs
        be
        become
        seem
        appear
        grow


4] Auxiliary (helping) verbs :

-- Auxiliary verbs, or “helping verbs,” are used in English to change another verb’s tense, voice, or mood.
-- When auxiliary verbs are used, there’s always a main verb that represents the main action. However, the auxiliary verb must 
    still be conjugated correctly.
-- he main auxiliary verbs are 'be', 'have', and 'do'.
-- We explain how they’re used specifically for conjugating below, but here are a few quick examples: 

    > I have eaten sushi many times before. (tense)
    > That piece of sushi was eaten by me. (voice)
    > Did you eat my sushi? (mood)


5] Modal auxiliary verbs :

-- Some auxiliary verbs are added to another verb to show necessity, possibility, or capability.
-- Like other auxiliary verbs, modal auxiliary verbs are not the main verb, but they do change its meaning slightly.
-- Some common examples are  - can, may, could, should, would, must, ought, and might.

    > I could swim across the English Channel, but 'should' I do it? 
    > She must be the strongest person on the team, and 'might' be the strongest person in the region.
     
    
6] Phrasal verbs :

-- Phrasal verbs are phrases that act as individual verbs, often combining two or more words and changing their meaning.
-- The verb get, for example, becomes many different phrasal verbs when combined with different prepositions. 

    > When the bus stops, passengers get out on the sidewalk. 
    > After losing his job, he’s getting by on savings.

-- The important thing to remember about phrasal verbs is that they act as a single verb, so you can still use them with other 
    verbs and prepositions.


****** Verb categories :

-- Aside from the different types, verbs also come in different categories. Dynamic, stative, and auxiliary verbs all make up the 
   categories below. 

1] Transitive, intransitive, and ditransitive :

-- Transitive, intransitive, and ditransitive refer to how a verb acts with direct and indirect objects.
-- A direct object is the person or thing that the action happens to, while an indirect object is the person or thing that receives 
   the direct object. 

    > Anay threw the ball to Shradhha.

-- In this example, the subject is Anay and the verb is threw. The direct object is the ball because that is what was thrown—Anay 
   did the action to the ball. The indirect object is Shradhha because he received the direct object, the ball.

-- Now,
-- Verbs that don’t use either a direct or indirect object are called intransitive. These verbs are complete actions by themselves. 

    > Examples: go, walk, run, talk, sit, sleep, work

-- Verbs that use a direct object, but not an indirect object, are called transitive. They don’t always need a direct object, but 
   they have the option.

    > Examples: clean, like, love, dislike, hate, want, learn, deserve, say

-- Verbs that use both direct and indirect objects are called ditransitive. They don’t always need an indirect object, but 
   they have the option. 

    > Examples: throw, make, buy, sell, read, give, lend, bring


****** Verb Conjugation :

-- Verb conjugation refers to how a verb changes to show a different person, tense, number or mood.


1] To be verb conjugation :

-- In English, we have six different persons: first person singular (I), second person singular (you), 
   third person singular (he/she/it/one), first person plural (we), second person plural (you), and third person plural (they).
-- We must conjugate a verb for each person.
-- The verb to be is a particularly notable verb for conjugation because it’s irregular.
-- Conjugation of the irregular verb to be:

First Person Singular	        Second Person Singular	        Third Person Singular
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    I am	                        you are	                        he/she/it is

First Person Plural	            Second Person Plural	        Third Person Plural
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    we are	                        you are	                        they are


2] Verb tense conjugation :

-- Verbs are also conjugated according to their tenses.
-- Verb tense indicates when the action in a sentence is happening (e.g., in the present, future, or past).
-- Regular verbs follow a standard pattern when conjugated according to tense.
-- Look at the examples below:

    > Conjugation of the regular verb 'to live' (based on tense):

    Simple Present	                Simple Past	                Simple Future
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        live	                        lived	                   will live
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Present Continuous	            Past Continuous	            Future Continuous
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        am living	                    was living	               will be living
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Present Perfect	                Past Perfect	            Future Perfect
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        have lived	                    had lived	               will have lived
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Present Perfect Continuous	    Past Perfect Continuous	    Future Perfect Continuous
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        have been living	            had been living	           will have been living
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
