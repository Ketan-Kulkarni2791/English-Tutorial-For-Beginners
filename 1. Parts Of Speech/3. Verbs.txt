-- Want to know where all the action is? Verbs!
-- Verbs are words that represent actions that are external (run, jump, work) and internal (love, think, consider).
-- Without verbs, you can’t do anything, you can’t feel anything—you can’t even be anything.  

*** What is a verb? 

-- Let’s start with the basics: What is a verb? Verbs are words that describe actions, whether physical or mental.
-- Verbs also describe a “state of being,” like the verbs be, become, or exist. 

    > Shradhha ran across the field, kicked the ball, and scored a goal. 
    > “I am the State.” —King Louis XIV

-- Some verbs also act as “helper verbs” to change the tense of another verb.
-- Likewise, these helper verbs can change a positive statement to a negative one with words like “not.” 

    > She has been jogging for a month and already feels her stamina increasing. 
    > “I don’t feel so good.” —Spider-Man

-- Every sentence needs at least one verb. If there’s no verb, it’s an incomplete sentence or a sentence fragment.
-- Except for imperative sentences (commands), a sentence also needs a subject, the thing doing the action. 


*** Types of verbs :

1] Dynamic (action) verbs :

-- Most verbs describe a physical action or activity, something external that can be seen or heard.
-- These verbs are formally known as dynamic verbs, but can also be called action or event verbs.  

    > Examples: walk, laugh, swim, play, eat, drink, sing, dance, talk, say

-- There are a lot of actions that take place in our minds and feelings, which are not external. 
-- Verbs that describe mental or internal actions are still dynamic verbs, but they’re not always so obvious.
-- These include “process verbs,” which describe actions of transition. 

    > Examples: consider, guess, change, grow, live, endure, succeed, fail
