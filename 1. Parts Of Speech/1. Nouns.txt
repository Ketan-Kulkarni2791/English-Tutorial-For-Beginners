-- A noun is a word that names something, such as a person, place, thing, or idea. 

****** Types of Nouns :

1] Concrete Nouns :

-- In english, concrete nouns are PEOPLE, PLACES or THINGS including ANIMALS.
-- That you can see, that you can smell, or taste, or hear, or touch.
-- For example,

PEOPLE 
    > a man, a woman, a boy, a girl
    > a teacher, an accountant, a software developer
    > Shradhaa
    > Mr. Kulkarni

PLACES
    > a house, a room, an apartment
    > a school, an office
    > Pune, Sambhaji nagar
    > a beach, a jungle

THINGS
    > a shoe, a dress, a jeans
    > a marker, a table, a chair
    > a dog, a cat, a tiger
    > a pizza, a pulav, a chocolate


2] Abstract Nouns:

-- Abstract nouns, unlike concrete nouns, are IDEAS, CONCEPTS, EMOTIONS.
-- You cannot see or smell an idea or a concept.
-- You cannot use your five senses with them.
-- For example,

IDEAS
    > a plan
    > a thought
    > a suggestion
    > an advice

CONCEPTS
    > a flower garden
    > an outer space
    > a costume theme
    > a religion

EMOTIONS
    > Love
    > Hate
    > Anger
    > Happy


3] Common Nouns vs Proper nouns:

-- Both of these nouns refer to people, places, things, ideas.
-- For example,

  Common Noun                    Proper Noun

> a woman                        Shradhha   (A specific woman. Always starts with capital letter.)
> a city                         Pune
> a dog                          Sheru

4. Singular and Plural nouns:

-- Singular in english means one.
-- For example,

    > a cat / one cat
    > a school / one school
    > a team / one team
    > a lady / one lady
    > a tomato / one tomato
    > a piano / one piano

-- Plural in english means more than one. It could be 2, 3, 4 or many.
-- For example,

    > cats / two cats / many cats
    > schools
    > teams
    > ladies
    > monkeys
    > tomatoes
    > pianos

-- Lady > La'd'y > 'd' is a consonent (any letter except a, e, i, o, u).
   consonent + y = ies
   Lady - Ladies
-- Monkey > Monk'e'y > 'e' is a vowel (5 vowels - a, e, i, o, u).
   Vowel + y = s
   Monkey - Monkeys
-- No rule for 'es' or 's' in the word ending with letter o. You just need to know the word.
