-- A noun is a word that names something, such as a person, place, thing, or idea. 

****** Types of Nouns :

1] Concrete Nouns :

-- In english, concrete nouns are PEOPLE, PLACES or THINGS including ANIMALS.
-- That you can see, that you can smell, or taste, or hear, or touch.
-- For example,

PEOPLE 
    > a man, a woman, a boy, a girl
    > a teacher, an accountant, a software developer
    > Shradhaa
    > Mr. Kulkarni

PLACES
    > a house, a room, an apartment
    > a school, an office
    > Pune, Sambhaji nagar
    > a beach, a jungle

THINGS
    > a shoe, a dress, a jeans
    > a marker, a table, a chair
    > a dog, a cat, a tiger
    > a pizza, a pulav, a chocolate


2] Abstract Nouns:

-- Abstract nouns, unlike concrete nouns, are IDEAS, CONCEPTS, EMOTIONS.
-- You cannot see or smell an idea or a concept.
-- You cannot use your five senses with them.
-- For example,

IDEAS
    > a plan
    > a thought
    > a suggestion
    > an advice

CONCEPTS
    > a flower garden
    > an outer space
    > a costume theme
    > a religion

EMOTIONS
    > Love
    > Hate
    > Anger
    > Happy


3] Common Nouns vs Proper nouns:

-- Both of these nouns refer to people, places, things, ideas.
-- For example,

  Common Noun                    Proper Noun

> a woman                        Shradhha   (A specific woman. Always starts with capital letter.)
> a city                         Pune
> a dog                          Sheru

1. In my class at Pune University, I have many friends. My best friend is Yashashree. I have a lot of love for her.
   She has a cute dog. Its name is Juju.

--> class, friends : Common nouns, Pune University : Proper noun
    friend : Common noun, Yashashree : Proper noun
    love : abstract noun
    dog, name : Common noun, Juju : Proper noun


4. Singular and Plural nouns:

-- Singular in english means one.
-- For example,

    > a cat / one cat
    > a school / one school
    > a team / one team
    > a lady / one lady
    > a tomato / one tomato
    > a piano / one piano

-- Plural in english means more than one. It could be 2, 3, 4 or many.
-- For example,

    > cats / two cats / many cats
    > schools
    > teams
    > ladies
    > monkeys
    > tomatoes
    > pianos

-- Lady > La'd'y > 'd' is a consonent (any letter except a, e, i, o, u).
   consonent + y = ies
   Lady - Ladies
-- Monkey > Monk'e'y > 'e' is a vowel (5 vowels - a, e, i, o, u).
   Vowel + y = s
   Monkey - Monkeys
-- No rule for 'es' or 's' in the word ending with letter o. You just need to know the word.


------------------------------
>> Pronunciation Practice :
------------------------------

-- When it comes to Pronunciation, there are 3 types of plural sound.

1. /s/    (sss)
2. /z/    (zzz)
3. /iz/   (izz)

-- For example,

    > cats              (/s/)
    > schools           (/z/)
    > teams             (/z/)
    > ladies            (/z/)
    > monkeys           (/z/)
    > tomatoes          (/z/)
    > pianos            (/z/)


-- Nouns that end in - s, sh, x, ch, z, to make the plural form of these nouns, you will add 'es' and sound will be '/iz/'.
-- For example,

    > bus       buses       /busiz/
    > bush      bushes      /bushiz/
    > fox       foxes       /foxiz/
    > beach     beaches     /beachiz/
    > quiz      quizes      /quiziz/

-- Nouns that ends in - f, fe. Sometimes the plural form of the words ending with f or fe ends with 'ves'.
-- For example,

    > roof      roofs       /rufs/
    > safe      safes       /safes/
    > leaf      leaves      /livz/
    > wife      wives       /wivez/
    > shelf     shelves     /shelvz/

    > clothes
    > scissors
    > pajamas
    > sunglasses

5] Compound Nouns :

-- Compound nouns are made up of two different words.
-- Sometimes, the compound nouns are single nouns.
-- For example,

    > toothpaste

-- Sometimes, there are two or more words hyphenated.
-- For example,

    > mother-in-law

-- Sometimes, there are two separate words.
-- For example,

    > ice cream

-- Now let's see the following combinations:

    > noun + noun           bedroom
    > noun + verb           haircut
    > noun + preosition     passer-by/passerby
    > verb + noun           washing machine
    > verb + preposition    drawback
    > preposition + noun    underground
    > adjective + verb      dry-cleaning
    > adjective + noun      software
    > preposition + verb    input

-- In the compound noun, the most significant word will be in the plural form.
-- For example,

    > newspaper         newspapers
    > brother-in-law    brothers-in-law
    > swimming pool     swimming pools
    > woman-doctor      women-doctors

6] Countable and Uncountable Nouns :

-- Countable nouns are the nouns that you can count.

-- Uncountable nouns are the nouns that you cannot count.
-- Such as - 1 snow, 2 snows, 100 snows.
-- Uncountable nouns are usually a type or a group and they are always singular.
-- For example,
    
    Countable Nouns:

    > a dog, 2 dogs, 100 dogs
    > a computer, 2 computers, 150 computers
    > an idea, 2 ideas, 50 ideas
    > a man, 2 men, 40 men

    Uncountable Nouns:

    > water
    > air
    > traffic
    > equipment
    > alphabet

-- How to identify whether the noun is countable or uncountable >

1} Some groups of words are often uncountable.

    Liquids         >       water, juice, milk, beer
    Powders         >       sugar, flour, salt, rice
    Material        >       wood, plastic, metal, paper (sheets of paper)
    Food            >       fruit, meat, cheese, bread
    Abstract ideas  >       time, information, love, beauty

2} Another trick is that most of the time, you can measure (not count) uncountable nouns.

    > I have 2 litres of milk.  (Measuring the milk in liters and then counting the litres.)
    > I have a glass of water.
    > I have 5 cups of coffee.
    > I have 2 kilograms of sugar.
    > I ate 2 pieces of cake.
    > I need pieces of paper/ metal.
    > I have some water.

-- Some words can be both countable and uncountable nouns.
-- For example,

    > I would like to eat some cake.
      I would like two pieces of cake.
      I would like to eat two cakes.    (Here we are considering the whole cake.)

    > I would like to eat some chicken.
      I would like two pieces of chicken.
      I see two chickens.               (Here chicken is an animal. Above, it is food.)
