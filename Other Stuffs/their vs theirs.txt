********* Theirs vs. Their *********

-- What is the difference between 'theirs' and 'their'? They're both pronouns. They're both third-person plurals. But they are of 
   different categories of pronouns.


1) Theirs :

-- 'Theirs' is the third-person plural possessive pronoun that is used to indicate that something belongs to a group of people or 
   things.
-- Keep in mind that 'theirs' is always used as a complete word and can't be separated into 'their' and 's'.
-- For example,

    > The car parked outside is theirs.
    > He's a friend of theirs.


2) Their :

-- 'Their' is a possessive determiner that is used to indicate that something belongs to multiple people or things.
-- It is used before a noun to show possession.
-- For example,

    > They are going to send their son to military school.

-- 'Their' is also used instead of 'his' or 'her' as a singular determiner' to refer to a person of unspecified gender when their 
    gender is not relevant to the context.
-- For example,

    > Every athlete should compete according to their weight.
