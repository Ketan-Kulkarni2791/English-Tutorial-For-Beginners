******** When Do You Use “Who” vs. “Whom”? *********

-- Whom is often confused with who.
-- Who is a subjective-case pronoun, meaning it functions as a subject in a sentence, and whom is an objective-case pronoun, meaning 
   it functions as an object in a sentence.


*** When to use who :

-- Who, like I, he, she, we, and they, is used as the subject of a sentence. That means it performs actions.
-- See how who is used as a subject in different ways:

    > Who rescued the dog?
    > I’m not sure who called my name.
    > Who is that man walking around Shradhha's house?
    > Do you know who baked this cake?

-- Who is doing the rescuing in the first sentence. Similarly, who called and who baked in the other examples.

*** When to use whom :

-- Whom is a little trickier. Like me, him, her, us, and them, whom is the object of a verb or preposition. 
-- That means whom is acted on.
-- See how whom acts as an object in each of these instances:

    > Whom did you see?
    > His grandchildren, whom he loves so much, are in town for a visit.
    > The cook, whom we just hired, failed to show up to work today.

-- In the first sentence, whom is being seen here, not doing the seeing.
-- In the other examples, whom is being loved and hired.
-- Whom is the direct object in all three sentences.
-- Take a look at these sentences:

    > She gave whom the package?
    > Whom should I call first?
    > My brother doesn’t remember whom he e-mailed the questions.

-- In these sentences, whom functions as an indirect object. That is the person on the receiving end of the action.
--  For example, the package was given to someone. It was given to whom.
-- Whom also commonly appears when it follows a preposition, as in the salutation “To whom it may concern.” Does it concern he? No. 
   Does it concern him? Yes.
-- When in doubt, substitute him (sometimes you’ll have to rephrase the sentence) and see if that sounds right. If him is OK, 
   then whom is OK. If the more natural substitute is he, then go with who. For example: You talked to who/whom? It would be 
   incorrect to say, “You talked to he?”, but saying, “You talked to him?” makes grammatical sense. So you would ask, 
   “You talked to whom?”
