-- We have 4 types of sentences :

1} Simple sentence
2} Complex sentence
3} Compound sentence
4} Compound Complex sentence


1] Simple sentence:

-- It has a subject and a verb or it contains one Clause.
-- It makes complete sense independently.
-- For example,

    > Ketan is a good man.      [Ketan -> subject, is -> verb, a good man -> object]
    > Tiger ran.

2] Compund sentence:

-- A compound sentence is a sentence that connects two independent clauses, typically with a coordinating conjunction like and or but.
-- The key here is independent clauses, which are clauses that can each stand alone as a separate sentence.
-- For example,

    > I have a pet dog. His name is Fluffy.
    > I have a pet dog, and his name is Fluffy.     [To combine above sentence, we just added , and coordinating conjunction 'and']
    > I have a pet iguana; his name is Fluffy.      [To combine above sentence, we can add just semi colon as well]

-- Although they’re talking about the same topic, the subject of each independent clause is different: The first clause’s subject is I, 
   and the second one’s subject is name.
-- That’s part of what makes them independent, and a sentence is considered compound only when it consists of independent clauses.
-- For example, the sentence below is not a compound sentence:

    > I have a pet dog whose name is Fluffy.

-- To be a compound sentence, it needs at least two subjects and two verbs.
